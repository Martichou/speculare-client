Speculare client (SP from now on) real-time monitoring Agent collects a lot of metrics from systems, hardware, VM, and applications with the least configuration possible. It runs permanently on your servers, computers, etc.

You can install SP on almost every platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
As things stand, SP is still in heavy development and is expected to become much more complex and complete over time.
